# AI Crypto Projects Tier List 🏆🤖

In this video, I’m ranking 11 AI crypto projects in a tier list. To be honest, I’ve been skeptical of many AI crypto projects and would rank most of them as D-tier or even F-tier if the list went that low. However, for a more engaging video, I'll rank them relative to each other.
